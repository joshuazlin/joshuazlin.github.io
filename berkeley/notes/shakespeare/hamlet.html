    Summary:
    <br><br>
    Hamlet is just like me, having gone to another country to study in University. He's having the time of his life, being philosophical, when suddenly he's called back to Denmark to attend his father's funeral. And he finds out his Uncle has married his Mother within a month of his father's death.
    <br><br>
    Hamlet's Father visits the castle of a ghost however, and calls Hamlet out to speak to him. The ghost reveals that Claudius (Hamlet's Uncle) had murdered him, and tasks Hamlet with getting revenge on Claudius. Hamlet swears that he will, but decides not to tell anybody about what the ghost says, instead feigning madness for the rest of the play. 
    <br><br>
    At the same time, the King and Queen are getting more and more worried about Hamlet's declining mental health. At the request of the King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern return to Denmark to talk to Hamlet to try and find out the source of his sadness, though Hamlet suspects that they have been tasked by the Queen, and is saddened by their betrayal.
    <br><br>
    Polonius, one of the King's men, tells the King that perhaps Hamlet is being tortured by the fact that Polonius' daughter, Ophelia, had spurned his advances, and suggests staging a meeting between Hamlet and Ophelia to find out if this is the cause of Hamlet's madness. Hamlet confronts Ophelia, but is maddened by her scornful words, and harshly rebukes Ophelia.
    <br><br>
    Hamlet recruits the help of a few visiting players to help catch the conscience of the King. Hamlet suggests that if the players were to re-enact the killing of Hamlet's Father, perhaps the King's conscience will recoil, and the audience shall see a visible reaction in the King's countenance. Indeed, the King reacts violently, and runs from the scene to seek light.
    <br><br>
    Hamlet is told by Guildenstern that he needs to speak with his mother in her bedchamber. He agrees, but stops by the chapel on the way, in which the King is confessing the murder to God. Hamlet, however, doesn't kill the King, saying that killing the King while he is praying would send his soul straight to heaven, which isn't what he wants. 
    <br><br>
    Hamlet continues to his mother's chamber, and harshly accosts her of infidelity to his father. Just as he was being violent, the Queen calls for help, and it is revealed that Polonius has been hiding behind a curtain, spying on the two. Hamlet kills Polonius, and drags his body of the bedchamber.
    <br><br>
    The King plans on sending Hamlet to England with a letter suggesting that Hamlet be executed the moment he steps off the ship. Hamlet, not knowing about this murderous plan, agrees however to leave Denmark, and leaves.
    <br><br>
    Laertes returns to Denmark, enraged that his father Polonius has been killed. At the same time, Ophelia goes mad with grief over the loss of both Hamlet and her father, and eventually drowns herself. Hamlet's ship is waylaid by pirates, and Hamlet makes an escape, editing the letter and sending Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to their deaths. Hamlet is now on his way back to meet Horatio.
    <br><br>
    Hamlet and Laertes meet at Ophelia's funeral ceremony, and, both enraged, enter a fight. It is suggested that they temporarily cease their brawl, however, and commence it with a swordfight at a later time. Claudius gives Laertes a poisoned sword, and also prepares a chalice of poisoned wine, to make sure that Hamlet is killed at this opportunity. However, during the swordfight, both Laertes and Hamlet are wounded by the poisoned sword, and the Queen drinks the poisoned wine. In his dying moments, Laertes reveals that the King was the conspirator all along, and Hamlet slays the King, dying with him.

    Come hither, gentlemen, and lay your hands<br>
    Again upon my sword. Swear by my sword<br>

    <b>Hamlet:</b> And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.<br>
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,<br>

    Analysis:
    <br>
    The ghost has come back to task Hamlet with taking revenge on Claudius. What's interesting about this scene is how it is staged; in reality the ghost would be someone under the floorboards, running to and fro shouting, there could be room for metatheatricality when Hamlet says "Here and Everywhere?"

    <b>1.2.1-16:</b><br>
    <b>Claudius:</b>Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death<br>
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted<br>
    To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom<br>
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,<br>
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature<br>
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him<br>
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.<br>
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,<br>
    Th'imperial jointress to this warlike state,<br>
    Have we as 'twere with a defeated joy,<br>
    With an auspicious and a dropping eye,<br>
    With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,<br>
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,<br>
    Taken to wife. Nor have we herein barred<br>
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone<br>
    With this affair along - for all, our thanks.<br><br>

    Analysis:<br>
    <font color = 'red'>UNSURE</font> Falsity of emotion is normally revealed in the play by
 an obvious artificiality of language, whether it be Osric's compliments
 or Laertes' rant at Ophelia's death, or Claudius' over-fluency which can
 produce such grotesque images as 'with an auspicious and a dropping
 eye.

    <b>2.2.468-525:</b><br>
    <b>Hamlet:</b>Ay so, good-bye to you.<br>
    Now I am alone.<br>
    Oh, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!<br>
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,<br>
    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,<br>
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit<br>
    That from her working all the visage wanned,<br>
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect,<br>
    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting<br>
    With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!<br>
    For Hecuba!<br>
    What's Hecuba to him or he to her<br>
    That he should weep for her? What would he do<br>
    Had he the motive and that for passion<br>
    That I have? He would drown the stage with tears<br>
    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,<br>
    Make mad the guilty and appall the free,<br>
    Confound the ignorant and amaze indeed<br>
    The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,<br>
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak <br>
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,<br>
    And can say nothing - no, not for a King<br>
    Upon whose property and most dear life<br>
    A damned defeat was made. Am I a coward?<br>
    Who calls me villain, breaks my pate across,<br>
    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face<br>
    Tweaks me by the nose, gives me the lie i'th'throat<br>
    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this?<br>
    Ha? 'Swounds, I should take it, for it cannot be<br>
    But i am pigeon-livered and lack gall<br>
    To make oppression bitter, or ere this<br>
    I should've fatted all the region kites<br>
    With this slave's offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!<br>
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!<br>
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,<br>
    That I, the son of a dear murdered,<br>
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, <br>
    Must like a whore unpack my heart with words<br>
    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,<br>
    A stallion! Fie upon't, foh!<br>
    About, my brains! Hmm - I have heard<br>
    That guilty creatures sitting at a play<br>
    Have by the very cunning of the scene<br>
    Been struck so to the soul that presently<br>
    They have proclaimed their malefactions.<br>
    For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak<br>
    With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players<br>
    Play something like the murder of my father<br>
    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;<br>
    I'll tent him to the quick. If 'a do blench,<br>
    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen<br>
    May be a dev'l, and the dev'l hath power<br>
    T'assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps<br>
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,<br>
    As he is very potent with such spirits,<br>
    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds<br>
    more relative than this. The play's the thing<br>
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.<br>

    <b>Player:</b> I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us<br>
    <b>Hamlet:</b> Oh, reform it altogether. And let those that play your<br>
    clowns speak no more than is set down for them; for there be<br>
    of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity<br>
    of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the meantime<br>
    some necessary question of the play be then to be consid-<br>

    <b>Horatio:</b>You will lose, my lord.<br>
