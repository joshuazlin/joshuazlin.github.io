    <b>Prolog 1-31</b><br>
<b>Prolog:</b>In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece<br>
The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,<br>
Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,<br>
Fraught with the ministers and instruments<br>
Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore<br>
Their crownets regal, from the Athenian bay<br>
Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made<br>
To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures<br>
The ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen,<br>
With wanton Paris sleeps; and that's the quarrel.<br>
To Tenedos they come;<br>
And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge<br>
Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains<br>
The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch<br>
Their brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city,<br>
Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,<br>
And Antenorides, with massy staples<br>
And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,<br>
Sperr up the sons of Troy.<br>
Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,<br>
On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,<br>
Sets all on hazard: and hither am I come<br>
A prologue arm'd, but not in confidence<br>
Of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited<br>
In like conditions as our argument,<br>
To tell you, fair beholders, that our play<br>
Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,<br>
Beginning in the middle, starting thence away<br>
To what may be digested in a play.<br>
Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:<br>
Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war.<br>

    <b>1.3.213-253:</b><br>
<b>AGAMEMNON</b><br>
What would you 'fore our tent?<br>
<b>AENEAS</b><br>
Is this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?<br>
<b>AGAMEMNON</b><br>
Even this.<br>
<b>AENEAS</b><br>
May one, that is a herald and a prince,<br>
Do a fair message to his kingly ears?<br>
<b>AGAMEMNON</b><br>
With surety stronger than Achilles' arm<br>
'Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice<br>
Call Agamemnon head and general.<br>
<b>AENEAS</b><br>
Fair leave and large security. How may<br>
A stranger to those most imperial looks<br>
Know them from eyes of other mortals?<br>
<b>AGAMEMNON</b><br>
How!<br>
<b>AENEAS</b><br>
Ay;<br>
I ask, that I might waken reverence,<br>
And bid the cheek be ready with a blush<br>
Modest as morning when she coldly eyes<br>
The youthful Phoebus:<br>
Which is that god in office, guiding men?<br>
Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?<br>
<b>AGAMEMNON</b><br>
This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy<br>
Are ceremonious courtiers.<br>
<b>AENEAS</b><br>
Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,<br>
As bending angels; that's their fame in peace:<br>
But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,<br>
Good arms, strong joints, true swords; and,<br>
Jove's accord,<br>
Nothing so full of heart. But peace, AEneas,<br>
Peace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips!<br>
The worthiness of praise distains his worth,<br>
If that the praised himself bring the praise forth:<br>
But what the repining enemy commends,<br>
That breath fame blows; that praise, sole sure,<br>
transcends.<br>
<b>AGAMEMNON</b><br>
Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself AEneas?<br>
<b>AENEAS</b><br>
Ay, Greek, that is my name.<br>
<b>AGAMEMNON</b><br>
What's your affair I pray you?<br>
<b>AENEAS</b><br>
Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.<br>
<b>AGAMEMNON</b><br>
He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.<br>
<b>AENEAS</b><br>
Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him:<br>
I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,<br>
To set his sense on the attentive bent,<br>
And then to speak.<br>
<b>AGAMEMNON</b><br>
Speak frankly as the wind;<br>
It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour:<br>
That thou shalt know. Trojan, he is awake,<br>
He tells thee so himself.<br>

<b>THERSITES</b><br>
Agamemnon, how if he had boils? full, all over,<br>
generally?<br>
<b>AJAX</b><br>
Thersites!<br>
<b>THERSITES</b><br>
And those boils did run? say so: did not the<br>
general run then? were not that a botchy core?<br>
<b>AJAX</b><br>
Dog!<br>
<b>THERSITES</b><br>
Then would come some matter from him; I see none now.<br>

Thou bitch-wolf's son, canst thou not hear?<br>

    <b>2.3.64-68:</b><br>
<b>THERSITES</b><br>
Here is such patchery, such juggling and such<br>
knavery! all the argument is a cuckold and a<br>
whore; a good quarrel to draw emulous factions<br>
and bleed to death upon. Now, the dry serpigo on<br>
the subject! and war and lechery confound all!<br>

    <b>3.3.159-183:</b><br>
    <b>Ulysses:</b>Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,<br>
Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,<br>
O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,<br>
Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;<br>
For time is like a fashionable host<br>
That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,<br>
And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,<br>
Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,<br>
And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not<br>
virtue seek<br>
Remuneration for the thing it was;<br>
For beauty, wit,<br>
High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,<br>
Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all<br>
To envious and calumniating time.<br>
One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,<br>
That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,<br>
Though they are made and moulded of things past,<br>
And give to dust that is a little gilt<br>
More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.<br>
The present eye praises the present object.<br>
Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,<br>
That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;<br>
Since things in motion sooner catch the eye<br>
Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,<br>
And still it might, and yet it may again,<br>

    <b>5.2.113-160:</b><br>
<b>ULYSSES</b><br>
All's done, my lord.<br>
<b>TROILUS</b><br>
It is.<br>
<b>ULYSSES</b><br>
Why stay we, then?<br>
<b>TROILUS</b><br>
To make a recordation to my soul<br>
Of every syllable that here was spoke.<br>
But if I tell how these two did co-act,<br>
Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?<br>
Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,<br>
An esperance so obstinately strong,<br>
That doth invert the attest of eyes and ears,<br>
As if those organs had deceptious functions,<br>
Created only to calumniate.<br>
Was Cressid here?<br>
<b>ULYSSES</b><br>
I cannot conjure, Trojan.<br>
<b>TROILUS</b><br>
She was not, sure.<br>
<b>ULYSSES</b><br>
Most sure she was.<br>
<b>TROILUS</b><br>
Why, my negation hath no taste of madness.<br>
<b>ULYSSES</b><br>
Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now.<br>
<b>TROILUS</b><br>
Let it not be believed for womanhood!<br>
Think, we had mothers; do not give advantage<br>
To stubborn critics, apt, without a theme,<br>
For depravation, to square the general sex<br>
By Cressid's rule: rather think this not Cressid.<br>
<b>ULYSSES</b><br>
What hath she done, prince, that can soil our mothers?<br>
<b>TROILUS</b><br>
Nothing at all, unless that this were she.<br>
<b>THERSITES</b><br>
Will he swagger himself out on's own eyes?<br>
<b>TROILUS</b><br>
This she? no, this is Diomed's Cressida:<br>
If beauty have a soul, this is not she;<br>
If souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,<br>
If sanctimony be the gods' delight,<br>
If there be rule in unity itself,<br>
This is not she. O madness of discourse,<br>
That cause sets up with and against itself!<br>
Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt<br>
Without perdition, and loss assume all reason<br>
Without revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid.<br>
Within my soul there doth conduce a fight<br>
Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate<br>
Divides more wider than the sky and earth,<br>
And yet the spacious breadth of this division<br>
Admits no orifex for a point as subtle<br>
As Ariachne's broken woof to enter.<br>
Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;<br>
Cressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven:<br>
Instance, O instance! strong as heaven itself;<br>
The bonds of heaven are slipp'd, dissolved, and loosed;<br>
And with another knot, five-finger-tied,<br>
The fractions of her faith, orts of her love,<br>
The fragments, scraps, the bits and greasy relics<br>
Of her o'er-eaten faith, are bound to Diomed.<br>
