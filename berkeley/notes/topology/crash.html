A <b>topology</b> on a set \(X\) is a collection \(\mathcal{T}\) of subsets of \(X\) having the following properties:<br>
1) \(\emptyset\) and \(X\) are in \(\mathcal{T}\)<br>
2) The union of the elements of any subcollection of \(\mathcal{T}\) is in \(\mathcal{T}\)<br>
3) The intersection of the elements of any finite subcollection of \(\mathcal{T}\) is in \(\mathcal{T}\).<br>
A set \(X\) for which a topology \(\mathcal{T}\) has been specified is called a <b>topological space</b>. We say that a subset \(U\) of \(X\) is an <b>open set</b> of \(x\) if \(U\) belongs to \(\mathcal{T}\).
</li>
<li>
Suppose that \(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{T'}\) are two topologies on a given set \(X\). If \(\mathcal{T'} \supset \mathcal{T}\), then we say that \(\mathcal{T'}\) is <b>finer</b> than \(\mathcal{T}\); if \(\mathcal{T'}\) <i>properly</i> contains \(\mathcal{T}\), we say that \(\mathcal{T'}\) is <b>strictly finer</b> than \(\mathcal{T}\). We also say that \(\mathcal{T}\) is <b>coarser</b> than \(\mathcal{T'}\), or <b>strictly coarser</b>, in these two respective situations. We say \(\mathcal{T}\) is <b>comparable</b> with \(\mathcal{T'}\) if either \(\mathcal{T'} \supset \mathcal{T}\) or \(\mathcal{T} \supset \mathcal{T'}\). 
</li>
<li>
If \(X\) is a set, a <b>basis</b> for a topology on \(X\) is a collection \(\mathcal{B}\) of subsets of \(X\) (called <b>basis elements</b>) such that<br>
1) For each \(x \in X\), there is at least one basis element \(B\) containing \(x\)<br>
2) If \(x\) belongs to the intersection of two basis elements \(B_1,B_2\), then there is a basis element \(B_3\) containing \(x\) such that \(B_3 \subset B_1 \cap B_2\)<br>
If \(\mathcal{B}\) satisfies these two conditions, then we define the <b>topology \(\mathcal{T}\) generated by \(\mathcal{B}\)</b> as follows: A subset \(U\) of \(X\) is said to be open in \(X\) (that is, to be an element of \(\mathcal{T}\)) if for each \(x \in U\), there is a basis element \(B \in \mathcal{B}\) such that \(x \in B\) and \(B \subset U\). Note that each basis element is itself an element of \(\mathcal{T}\).
</li>
<li>
If \(\mathcal{B}\) is the collection of all open intervals in the real line \((a,b)\) for finite \(a,b: a < b\), the topology generated by \(\mathcal{B}\) is called the <b>standard topology</b> on the real line. If \(\mathcal{B}'\) is the collection of all half-open intervals \([a,b)\) for finite \(a,b : a < b\), the topology generated by \(\mathcal{B}'\) is called the <b>lower limit topology</b> on \(\mathbb{R}\), denoted \(\mathbb{R}_l\). Finally, let \(K\) defnote the set of all numbers of the form \(1/n\) for \(n \in \mathbb{N}\), and let \(\mathcal{B}''\) be the collection of all open intervals \((a,b)\), along with all sets of the form \((a,b) - K\). The topology generated by \(\mathcal{B}''\) will be called the <b>K-topology</b> on \(\mathbb{R}\), denotes \(\mathbb{R}_K\).
</li>
<li>
A <b>subbasis</b> \mathcal{S} for a topology on \(X\) is a collection of subsets of \(X\) whose union equals \(X\). The <b>topology generated by the subbasis</b> \(\mathcal{S}\) is defined to be the collection \(\mathcal{T}\) of all unions of finite intersections of elements of \(S\).

Let \(X\) be a topological space. Suppose that \(\mathcal{C}\) is a collection of open sets of \(X\) such that for each open set \(U\) of \(X\) and each \(x\) in \(U\), there is an element \(C\) of \(\mathcal{C}\) such that \(x \in C \subset U\). Then \(\mathcal{C}\) is a basis for the topology of \(X\).

Let \(\mathcal{B},\mathcal{B}'\) be bases for the topologies \(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{T}'\), respectively, on \(X\). Then the following are equivalent:<br>
1)\(\mathcal{T}'\) is finer than \(\mathcal{T}\)<br>
2)For each \(x \in X\) and each basis element \(B \in \mathcal{B}\) containing \(x\), there is a basis element \(B' \in \mathcal{B}'\) such that \(x \in B' \subset B\).

2) All intervals of the form \([a_0,b)\), where \(a_0\) is the smallest element (if any) of \(X\)<br>
3) All intervals of the form \((a,b_0]\), where \(b_0\) is the largest element (if any) of \(X\)<br>

the maps \(\pi_1,\pi_2\) are called the <b>projections</b> of \(X \times Y\) onto its first and second factors, respectively.

Let \(X\) be a topological space with topology \(\mathcal{T}\). If \(Y\) is a subset of \(X\), the collection
