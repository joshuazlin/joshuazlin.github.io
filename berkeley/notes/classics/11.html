    <p style="font-size: 30px">Chapter 11: Stoic physics: the first principles and their relation (LS)</p>
    <!--it's not really random i swear-->
    <p>Random number: 23</p>

    For the Stoics, there are two principles, that which acts [God, Logos, Zeus, Pneuma, Fire, ...] and that which is acted upon [unqualified matter]. The matter is unqualified in the sense that it by itself has no qualities whatsoever, like wax, except not even waxy. It is indestructible, immobile, finite, and has no intrinsic shape. Matter is shaped and given qualities by God. Pneuma pervades matter and is mixed with it through and through (completely blended). God shapes matter by imparting to it "seminal reasons". 
    <br><br>
    For the Stoics all beings are bodies. To be is to be capable of acting upon something, or being acted upon by something. The only things that can act on something, or be acted upon by something, are bodies, hence all beings are bodies. This implies that both matter [that which is acted upon] and God [that which acts] are bodies. 
    <br><br>
    The Stoics maintain that there is a strict sequence of causes that is inescapable known as Fate. Fate is the law of nature embedded in God.
