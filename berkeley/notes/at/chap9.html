$$E^n = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n : |x| \leq 1\}$$
$$U^n = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n : |x| < 1\}$$
$$S^{n-1} = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n : |x| = 1\}$$
In this section, we assume \(X^*\) is Hausdorff, and that \(X\) is a closed subset of \(X^*\) such that \(X^* - X\) is the disjoint union of open subsets \(e^n_\lambda, \lambda \in \Lambda\); each \(e^n_\lambda\) is assumed to be homeomorphic to \(U^n\), and is called an <i>n-cell</i>. Finally, it is assumed that each <i>n-cell</i> is attached to \(X\) by a characteristic map, that is for each \(\lambda\) there exists continuous map:
$$f_\lambda : E^n \to \bar{e}^n_\lambda$$
such that \(f_\lambda\) maps \(U^n\) homeomorphically onto \(e^n_\lambda\) and \(f_\lambda(S^{n-1}) \subset X\). If the number of \(n\)-cells is finite, then no additional requirements are necessary. However, in the case of an infinite family of \(n\)-cells, then we also require that a subset \(A\) of \(X^*\) is closed if and only if \(A \cap X\) and \(f_\lambda^{-1}(A)\) are closed for all \(\lambda \in \Lambda\). 
<br><br>
The question we want to know now is, if we know what \(X\) looks like, can we figure out what \(X^*\) looks like? Turns out we can. <br>
Theorem: Under the above hypothesis, \(H_q(X^*,X) = 0\) for all \(q \neq n\). For each \(\lambda \in \Lambda\), the characteristic map \(f_\lambda\) induces a monomorphism of relative homology groups \(f_{\lambda *} : H_n(E^n,S^{n-1}) \to H_n(X^*,X)\) and \(H_n(X^*,X)\) is the direct sum of the image subgroups. Thus, \(H_n(X^*,X)\) is a free abelian group with basis in one to one correspondence with the set of cells \(\{e^n_\lambda | \lambda \in \Lambda\}\)
<br>
Corollary: The homomorphism \(i_* : H_q(X) \to H_q(X^*)\) is an isomorphism except possibly for \(q = n\) and \(q = n-1\); the only nontrivial part of the homology sequence of the pair \((X^*,X)\) is the following:
$$0 \to H_n(X) \xrightarrow{i_*} H_n(X^*) \to H_n(X^*,X) \to H_{n-1}(X) \xrightarrow{i_*} H_{n-1}(X^*) \to 0$$

A structure of CW-complex is prescribed on a space \(X\) (which is <i>always</i> assumed to be Haudorff) by the prescription of an ascending sequence of <i>closed</i> subspaces:
$$X^0 \subset X^1 \subset X^2 \subset \cdot\cdot\cdot$$
which satisfy the following conditions:
<ul>
<li>
X^0 has the discrete topology
</li>
<li>
For \(n > 0\), \(X^n\) is obtained from \(X^{n-1}\) by adjoining a collection of \(n\)-cells in an appropriate manner (i.e. homeomorphing the interior of the cell, and the boundary gets mapped to the skeleton \(X^{n-1}\)).
</li>
<li>
\(X\) is the union of the subspaces \(X^i\) for \(i \geq 0\)
</li>
<li>
The space \(X\) and the subspaces \(X^q\) all have the weak topology: A subset \(A\) is closed if and only if \(A \cap \bar{e}^n\) is closed for all \(n\)-cells, \(e^n\), \(n = 0, 1, 2, ...\)

<b>The Homology Groups of a CW-Complex</b> <button class = 'doHide' onclick= 'yes(1)'></button>
<br>
Let \(K = \{K^n | n = 0,1,2,...\}\) denote a CW-structure imposed on topological space \(X\). We know that $$H_q(K^n,K^{n-1}) = 0$$ for \(q \neq n\) and that $$H_n(K^n,K^{n-1})$$ is a free abelian group generated by the \(n\)-cells of \(K\). We also know that
$$H_q(K^n) = 0$$
for all \(q > n\). Now we define:
$$C_n(K) = H_n(K^n, K^{n-1})$$
$$j_{n-1} \circ \partial_* = d_n : C_n(K) \to C_{n-1}(K)$$
$$H_n(K^n,K^{n-1}) \xrightarrow{\partial_*} H_{n-1}(K^{n-1}) \xrightarrow{j_{n-1}} H_{n-1}(K^{n-1},K^{n-2})$$
where \(\delta_*\) is the boundary operator and \(j_{n-1}\) is the homomorphism induced by the inclusion map. We can now define \(Z_n(K), B_n(K), H_n(K)\) appropriately as the kernel of \(d\), the image of \(d\), the quotient of \(Z\) by \(B\). <br>



Now consider:
$$H_n(X) \xleftarrow{k_n} H_n(K^n) \xrightarrow{j_n} H_n(K^n,K^{n-1}) = C_n(K)$$
Here \(j_n\) and \(k_n\) are homomorphisms induced by inclusion maps. In the above diagram, \(k_n\) is an epimorphism, \(j_n\) is a monomorphism, image \(j_n = Z_n(K)\), kernel \(k_n = j_n^{-1}(B_n(K))\). 
<br>
We can understand these results 'intuitively'. \(k_n\) represents inclusion from \(K^n\) to \(X\), and intuitively this can only make the \(n\)-dimensional structure 'simpler' (you can't introduce more complexity with higher dimensional manifolds!! Think about a circle going to a sphere; you've simplified one-dimensional group by heaps), so its a surjection. \(j_n\) on the other hand is a mapping which quotients out the skeleton \(K^{n-1}\), which can only make the structure <i>more complicated</i>, (imagine three points connected with edges, and the face in the middle filled in. Now quotient those three points together. Before you had \(\mathbb{Z}\), now you have the free group on three generators!) Hence it is a monomorphism.<br>
Then \(j_n \circ k_n^{-1}\) defines an isomorphism
$$\theta : H_n(X) \to H_n(K)$$

<b>The Euler Characteristic of a CW-Complex</b> <button class = 'doHide' onclick= 'yes(1)'></button>

For any abelian group \(A\), let \(r(A)\) denote the rank of \(A\). Let \(K\) be a finite CW-complex on the space \(X\). Then the euler characteristic satisfies the following equation:
$$\chi(K) = \sum_n (-1)^n r(H_n(X))$$
and is invariant on what choice of CW-complex we choose to impose on \(X\).

Let \(K = \{K^n\}\) be a CW-complex on the space \(X\). For each \(n\)-cell \(e^n_\lambda\), define \(\bar{e}^n_\lambda\) as the closure, and \(\dot{e}^n_\lambda\) as the border of the \(n\)-cell. Notice that \(H_n(\bar{e}^n_\lambda,\dot{e}^n_\lambda)\) is infinite cyclic, and hence there are two ways to choose a generator. We can then define \(a^n_\lambda\) as our choice of generator for each \(n\)-cell. We know that \(H_n(K^n, K^{n-1})\) is a free abelian group generated by the set of \(n\)-cells; hence we can then define \(b^n_\lambda\) as our choice of generator \(a^n_\lambda\) under the inclusion map \(l_{\lambda *} : H_n(\bar{e}^n_\lambda, \dot{e}^n_\lambda) \to H_n(K^n,K^{n-1})\) (it's kind of like a choice of basis in linear algebra). Notice that \(\{b^n_\lambda\}\) forms a basis for \(C_n(K) = H_n(K^n, K^{n-1})\).
<br>
The above describes the situation for \(n > 0\). Notice however that for \(n = 0\); we have a <i>canonical</i> isomorphism from \(H_0(e^0_\lambda) \to \mathbb{Z}\), there isn't any choice to be made. Canonically we choose "having the point" to be \(1\) over "not having the point".  
<br><br>
Recall that we have boundary homomorphisms:
$$d_n : C_n(K) \to C_{n-1}(K)$$
defined by the composition of a boundary homomorphism and an inclusion homomorphism:
$$H_n(K^n,K^{n-1}) \xrightarrow{\partial_*} H_{n-1}(K^{n-1}) \xrightarrow{j} H_{n-1}(K^{n-1},K^{n-2})$$
Since \(\{b^n_\lambda\}\) forms a basis for \(C_n(K)\), boundary homomorphisms \(d_n\) are completely determined by where \(d_n\) takes the basis elements. So we have:
$$d_n(b^n_\lambda) = \sum_{\mu} [b^n_\lambda : b^{n-1}_{\mu}] b^{n-1}_\mu $$
where \([b^n_\lambda : b^{n-1}_{\mu}]\) is some constant that we call the <i>incidence number</i> of the cells \(e^n_\lambda\) and \(e^{n-1}_\mu\) (w.r.t. the chosen orientations).

A CW-complex is <i>regular</i> if for each cell \(e^n\), \(n > 0\), there exists a characteristic map \(f : E^n \to \bar{e}^n\) which is a homeomorphism. 

Regular CW - complexes have these properties:
<ul>
<li>
If \(m < n\) and \(e^m\) and \(e^n\) are cells such that \(e^m \cap \dot{e}^n \neq \emptyset \), then \(e^m \subset \dot{e}^n\)
</li>
<li>
For any \(n\)-cell \(e^n\), \(n \geq 0\), \(\bar{e}^n\) and \(\dot{e}^n\) are the underlying spaces of sub-complexes. Also \(\dot{e}^n\) is the union of closures of \((n-1)\)-cells. 
</li>
<li>
If \(e^m \subset \bar{e}^n\) we say that \(e^m \leq e^n\) and that \(e^m\) is a face of \(e^n\). We say that \(e^m < e^n\) is a proper face if additionaly \(e^m \neq e^n\). Let \(e^n\) and \(e^{n+2}\) be cells of a regular cell complex such that \(e^n\) is a face of \(e^{n+2}\). Then there are exactly two \((n+1)\)-cells \(e^{n+1}\) such that \(e^n < e^{n+1} < e^{n+2}\).

Knowing this; we can now assert the following theorem.<br>
Theorem: Let \(K\) be a regular CW-complex on the topological space \(X\). For each pair \((e^n_\lambda,e^{n-1}_\mu)\) consisting of an n-cell and a (n-1)-cell of \(K\), let there be given an integer \(\alpha^n_{\lambda\mu} \in \{-1,0,1\}\) such that it satisfies the properties that \([b^n_\lambda : b^{n-1}_\mu]\) does above. Then there exists a <i>unique</i> way to choose orientations \(b^n_\lambda\) such that \(\alpha^n_{\lambda\mu} = [b^n_\lambda : b^{n-1}_\mu]\). <strike>In other words; the orientations are <i>predetermined</i> by the structure, you have no freedom of choice???</strike> No. In other words, different orientations lead to different incidence numbers; and different incidence numbers lead to different orientations. In other words; provide me with a set of (compatible) incidence numbers, and I'll provide you with your orientations.
