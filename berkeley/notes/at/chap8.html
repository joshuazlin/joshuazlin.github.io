Here, we wish to use the tools garnered to prove that:
$$\overset{\sim}{H_i}(S^n)=
\begin{cases}
\mathbb{Z}, \qquad \:\: \:\text{if } i = n\\
\{0\}, \qquad \text{if } i \neq n
\end{cases}$$
The proof is by induction on \(n\). First, notice that it works for \(n = 0\). To make the inductive step, we identify \(S^n\) with the equator of \(S^{n+1}\) (i.e. setting the last variable to be \(0\)), and we consider the two hemispherical subsets of \(S^{n+1}\), \(E^{n+1}_+\) where the last variable is greater than or equal to \(0\), and \(E^{n+1}_-\) where the last variable is less than or equal to \(0\). Now, consider the following diagram of homology groups:
$$\overset{\sim}{H_i}(S^n) \overset{\partial_*}{\leftarrow} H_{i+1} (E^{n+1}_-,S^n) \overset{k_*}{\rightarrow} H_{i+1}(S^{n+1},E^{n+1}_+)\overset{j_*}{\leftarrow} \overset{\sim}{H_{i+1}}(S^{n+1})$$
Here, \(j,k\) are homomorphisms induced from inclusion maps. 
<br>Consideration of the exactness of the homology sequence of the pair \((E^{n+1}_-,S^n)\) and the fact that \(E^{n+1}_-\) is contractible leads to the conclusion that \(\partial_*\) is an isomorphism. 
<br>Consideration of the exactness of the homology sequence of the pair \((S^{n+1},E^{n+1}_+)\) and the fact that \(E^{n+1}_+\) is contractible leads to the conclusion that \(j_*\) is an isomorphism.
<br>Naively, we might hope that \(k_*\) is an isomorphism simply by excising the top half of the sphere. However, this naive approach doesn't work; since the closure of the top half isn't included in the interior of the set we are excising from. However, we can 'hack it':

$$ 
    \begin{array}{ccc}
      H_{i+1}(E^{n+1}_-,S^n)&\xrightarrow{k_*}&H_{i+1}(S^{n+1},E^{n+1}_+)\\
      \searrow{h_*}& &\nearrow{e_*}\\
       &H_{i+1}(S^{n+1}-W,E^{n+1}_+-W) & 
    \end{array}
 $$

(Just like I had to hack that commutative triangle in) Instead of excising the whole of the top hemisphere, we only excise the 'top cap' of the hemisphere \(W\) (where the last coordinate is, say, greater than or equal to \(1/2\)). Clearly then \(e^*\) is an isomorphism. But \(h_*\) is an isomorphism too, because the map \(h\) is a homotopy equivalence of pairs, there is an obvious deformation retraction from one space to the other. It follows that \(k_*\) is an isomorphism too, completing our proof. 
<br><br>
Following this discussion, you can consider continuous maps from \(S^n\) to itself and prove some pretty cool things.

<b>Homology of Finite Graphs</b> <button class = 'doHide' onclick= 'yes(1)'></button>
<br>
A <i>finite regular graph</i> is a pair consisting of a Hausdorff space \(X\) and a finite subspace \(X^0\) (points of \(X^0\) are called <i>vertices</i>) such that the following conditions hold:
<ul>
<li>
\(X - X^0\) is the disjoint union of a finite number of open subsets \(e_1,e_2,...e_k\) called <i>edges</i>. Each \(e_i\) is homeomorphic to an open interval of the real line.
</li>
<li>
The point set boundary, \(\bar{e_i}-e_i\), of the edge \(e_i\) consists of two distinct vertices, and the pair \((\bar{e_i},e_i)\) is homeomorphic to the pair \(([0,1],(0,1))\).
</li>
</ul>
Note that the graph is compact. If a vertex belongs to the closure of the edge, we say that the two are incident. We can subdivide by inserting additional vertices along edges. We will use \(\dot{e} = \bar{e} - e\) to denote the boundary of an edge. 
<br><br>
Theorem: Let \((X,X^0)\) be a finite, regular graph with edges \(e_1,e_2,...,e_k\). Then the inclusion map \((\bar{e_i},\dot{e_i}) \to (X,X^0)\) induces a monomorphism \(H_q(\bar{e_i},\dot{e_i}) \to H_q(X,X^0)\) for \(i = 1,2,...,k\) and \(H_q(X,X_0)\) is the direct sum of the image subgroups. It follows that \(H_1(X,X^0)\) is a free abelian group of rank \(k\), and \(H_q(X,X^0) = 0\) for \(q \neq 1\). 
<br><br>
To prove this, first denote \(a_i\) to be the midpoint of edge \(e_i\) and \(A = \cup a_i\) the union of all the midpoints. Next, denote \(d_i\) to be a closed ball around each midpoint \(a_i\), and \(D = \cup d_i\). Now consider the following diagram:

$$
\require{AMScd}
\begin{CD} 
H_q(D,D-A)    @>{1}>> H_q(X,X-A) @<{2}<< H_q(X,X^0) \\
@AA{5}A       @AAA  @AA{6}A \\
H_q(d_i,d_i - \{a_i\}) @>{3}>> H_q(\bar{e_i},\bar{e_i}-\{a_i\}) @<{4}<< H_q(\bar{e_i},\dot{e_i})
 \end{CD}$$


All homomorphisms are induced from inclusion maps, so both squares are commutative. We assert that <i>all horizontal arrows are isomorphisms</i>. Arrows 2 and 4 are isomorphisms because they represent deformation retractions, and arrows 1 and 3 are isomorphisms because they represent excisions. The theorem then follows by considering that \(D\) is a disjoint union of components, and thinking about arrow 5. 
<br><br>
Considering the exact sequence of \((X,X^0)\) we can obtain the homology groups. \(H_q(X) = 0\) for \(q > 1\), \(H_1(X)\) is a free abelian group, and
$$\text{rank}(H_0(X)) - \text{rank}(H_1(X)) = \text{Euler Characteristic} = \text{#vertices - #edges}$$

<b>The Mayer-Vietoris Exact Sequence</b> <button class = 'doHide' onclick= 'yes(1)'></button>
<br>
Let \(A\) and \(B\) be subsets of the topological space \(X\) such that \(X = (\text{interior }A) \cup (\text{interior }B)\). Then it is possible to define natural homomorphisms
$$\Delta : H_n(X) \to H_{n-1}(A \cap B)$$
for all values of \(n\) such that the following sequence is exact:
$$\cdot\cdot\cdot \xrightarrow{\Delta} H_n(A \cap B) \xrightarrow{\phi} H_n(A) \oplus H_n(B) \xrightarrow{\psi} H_n(X) \xrightarrow{\Delta} H_{n-1}(A \cap B) \xrightarrow{\phi} \cdot\cdot\cdot$$
If \(A \cap B \neq \emptyset\), the sequence remains exact if we substitute reduced homology groups for ordinary homology groups in dimension \(0\).
<br><br>
<hr>
The maps are defined as follows.
$$i_* : H_n(A \cap B) \to H_n(A)$$
$$j_* : H_n(A \cap B) \to H_n(B)$$
$$k_* : H_n(A) \to H_n(X)$$
$$l_* : H_n(B) \to H_n(X)$$
are homomorphisms induced by the respective inclusion maps. Using these, we define:
$$\phi : H_n(A \cap B) \to H_n(A) \oplus H_n(B)$$
$$\phi(x) = (i_*(x),j_*(x))$$
$$\psi : H_n(A) \oplus H_n(B) \to H_n(X)$$
$$\psi(u,v) = k_*(u) - l_*(v)$$
