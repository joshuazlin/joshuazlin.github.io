<b>Difference between homotopic and homeomorphic</b> <button class = 'doHide' onclick= 'yes(1)'></button>
<br>
Homeomorphic is stronger than homotopic. For instance, a deformation retract \(A\) of \(X\) is homotopic, but not necessarily homeomorphic. (Homeomorphic is literally isomorphic, you have a bijective "bicontinuous" map) Of course, deformation retract is a stronger condition than homotopic too.

<b>Fundamental group of the real projective plane</b> <button class = 'doHide' onclick= 'yes(1)'></button>

Is NOT SIMPLE!! In fact:
$$\pi(RP^2) \approx \langle a | a^2 \rangle$$
<a href = "http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/383537/an-intuitive-idea-about-fundamental-group-of-mathbbrp2">Link to understand why it's not simple</a> that didn't really help; but the idea (I think) is that \(S^2\) is a covering space of \(RP^2\), so you can lift paths in \(RP^2\) into \(S^2\). The base point in \(RP^2\) corresponds to two antipodal points in \(S^2\). Non-trivial paths \(\gamma\) get lifted to a path in \(S^2\) that starts at one point and ends at the antipode. For some reason \(2\gamma\) is trivial when it gets lifted though...

<b>Finding continuous maps</b> <button class = 'doHide' onclick= 'yes(1)'></button>
<br>
It's sometimes easier to take an indirect route. For instance; you'd think that there's no continuous surjective map from \(S^2\) to \(S^1\), but you'd be wrong. Just project \(S^2\) to a line, (i.e. just take the \(z\) component), and now wrap the line around the circle. <i>Composition of continuous maps are continuous</i>. Be indirect. Be holy.
