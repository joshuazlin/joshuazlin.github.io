Given a potential \(V(x)\) that is constant in time, to find the wavefunctions that solve the Shrodinger's equation, first we look for <b>stationary states</b>, by assuming that 
$$\Psi(x,t) = \psi(x) \phi(t)$$
for some functions \(\psi\) (a function of space alone) and \(\phi\) (a function of time alone). By substituting this into Shrodinger's equation we get:
$$i \hbar \frac{1}{\phi} \frac{d \phi}{dt} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{1}{\psi}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} + V$$
Note that since the left hand side is a function in time alone, and the right hand side a function in space alone, both sides must be equal to some constant in space <i>and</i> time \(E\). So we have for the left hand side:
$$i \hbar \frac{1}{\phi} \frac{d \phi}{dt} = E$$
$$\frac{d\phi}{dt}  = -\frac{iE}{\hbar}\phi$$
$$\phi(t) = e^{-iEt/\hbar}$$
(The constant doesn't matter since we care about \(\Psi = \psi\phi\) and we can renormalise later). Now the right hand side gives us the <b>time-independent Shrodinger equation</b>:
$$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} + V\psi = E\psi$$
By solving this equation and finding \(\Psi = \psi\phi\), we find our stationary states corresponding to our potential function. These are called stationary states because <i>every expectation value is constant in time</i>. Moreover, the energy of each stationary state is <i>precisely</i> given by \(E\) (the standard deviation is zero in this measurement). For the piece de resistance; it turns out that every solution to the Shrodinger equation is a linear combination of stationary states.

<b>Problem 2.1</b> <button class = 'doHide' onclick= 'yes(1)'>Solution</button>
<br><br>
Prove the following three theorems:
<ul>
<li>
For normalizable solutions, the separation constant \(E\) is <i>real</i>.
</li>
<li>
The time-independent wave function \(\psi(x)\) can always be taken to be <i>real</i>. This doesn't mean that every solution to the time-independent Schrodinger equation <i>is</i> real; what it says is that if you've got one that is <i>not</i>, it can always be expressed as a liner combination of solutions (with the same energy) that <i>are</i>.
</li>
<li>
If \(V(x)\) is an even function, then \(\psi(x)\) can always be taken to be either even or odd (in an analogous manner to the second part of this question).
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>


<div id = 'proof1' style = "display:none;">
<br>
<i>Solution:</i> 
<ul>
<li>
Suppose that the separation constant is not real, i.e. \(E = E_0 + i\Gamma\) where \(E_0,\Gamma \in \mathbb{R}\). Then for the time-dependent portion of the Shrodinger equation:

$$i\hbar \frac{d\phi}{dt} = (E_0 + i\Gamma)\phi$$
$$\phi(t) = e^{\Gamma t/\hbar}e^{-iE_0t/\hbar}$$
So we've picked up an additional \(e^{\Gamma t/\hbar}\) term that grows with time. This cannot be true for normalizable functions (as they are supposed to stay normalizable, but this implies the function grows and grows with time)
</li>
<li>
Consider the time-independent Shrodinger equation:
$$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} + V\psi = E\psi$$
Notice that if \(\psi\) is a solution to this equation (for some \(E\)), then \(\psi^*\) is also a solution for the same \(E\). This implies \((\psi+\psi^*)\) and \(i(\psi-\psi^*)\) are both also solutions to the equation for the same \(E\). Notice however that both of these solutions are purely real (!!) This implies:
$$\psi = \frac{1}{2}(\psi + \psi^*) + \frac{1}{2}i^3 (i(\psi - \psi^*))$$
is a linear combination of <i>real</i> solutions to the time-independent Shrodinger equation, hence arbitrary solution \(\psi\) can always been expressed as a linear combination of real solutions.
</li>
<li>
Consider the time-independent Shrodinger equation
$$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} + V\psi = E\psi$$
Suppose \(V\) is an even function, and that \(psi(x)\) is one solution to the equation. Notice then that:
$$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi(-x)}{dx^2} + V(x)\psi(-x) = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi(-x)}{dx^2} + V(-x)\psi(-x)=E\psi(-x)$$
Therefore \(\psi(-x)\) is also a solution for the same \(E\). Notice however that \((\psi(x)+\psi(-x))\) is an even function, and that \((\psi(x)-\psi(-x))\) is an odd function. Hence
$$\psi(x) = \frac{1}{2}(\psi(x)+\psi(-x)) + \frac{1}{2}(\psi(x)-\psi(-x))$$
for arbitrary \(\psi(x)\) expresses it as a linear combination of even and odd functions.
</li>
</ul>

<b>Problem 2.2</b> <button class = 'doHide' onclick= 'yes(2)'>Solution</button>
<br><br>
Show that \(E\) must exceed the minimum value of \(V(x)\), for every normalizable solution to the time-independent Shrodinger equation. What is the classical analog to this statement?
</div>
</div>



<div id = 'proof2' style = "display:none;">
<br>
<i>Solution:</i> 
<br>
Consider the time-independent Shrodinger equation:
$$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} + V\psi = E\psi$$
Rearranging, we have:
$$\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}[V(x) - E]\psi$$
If \(E < V_{\text{min}}\), then \(\psi\) and its second derivative always have the <i>same sign</i>. This function cannot possibly be normalized, since if \(\psi\) is ever positive, then it will have positive curvature and curve <i>away</i> from the axis, and become increasing positive. Similarly, if \(\psi\) is ever negative, it will have negative curvature and curve <i>away</i> from the axis, and become increasingly negative.

Now we move on to investigating some toy problems so that we gain some insight. Suppose we have an infinite well, i.e.:
$$V(x) = 
\begin{cases}
0,  & \text{if $0 \leq x \leq a$} \\
\infty, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
