# Exporting MP3s with LAME

A well formatted MP3 is essential to creating a loop that doesn't "skip" when it repeats. The best way to do this is using Audacity and LAME.

1. Download [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/download/).
2. Download [LAME for Audacity](http://lame.buanzo.org/). This website is pretty dense - you're looking for the .exe if you're on Windows, or .dmg for Mac. If you're on Linux, you probably don't need this guide.
3. Install both, then open Audacity.
4. Drag your audio file to the Audacity window.
5. Select the looping section with your mouse. Test that it loops well by shift-clicking on the "Play" button. If it doesn't, adjust the selection handles until it does.
6. Click File->Export Selected Audio
7. Make sure the type is "MP3 Files".
8. Hit "Options" and make the Bit Rate Mode "Average" and the Quality "192kbps". This is a good balance between file size and audio fidelity.
9. Hit save! You now have a fresh MP3 ready to use in your very own Hues :)
