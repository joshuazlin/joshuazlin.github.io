    I've uploaded some of the fun things I've done with geometry here.
    <br><br>

    This was my first try making a Klein Bottle. I was playing around with using python to generate the geometry of the Klein Bottle (by parametizing the surface as a sort of cylinder that wraps into itself); but I couldn't get the glass to look like real glass, so you can't really see 'inside'. 
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    For this Klein Bottle, I tried cutting out every second face, but leaving the material of the Klein Bottle as opaque, so you can see inside how it wraps around. 
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    To better visualise the the Klein Bottle, I painted one strip of faces red, and changed the material into a green glass. You can see that the strip gets refracted when it enters the Klein Bottle; pretty interesting. 
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    For this one, I tried to make it as realistic as possible; but I'm still not happy with the low resolution of the glass on the 'inside' of the Klein Bottle... it just doesn't look very realistic.

    I tried experimenting with other shapes too; for instance fractal geometry like the Sierpinski's Pyramid. At first, I had python recursively define the pyramid; but then I realised it was much easier to use Blender's inbuilt array tools to simply copy and paste the pyramid multiple times, making it more and more intricate.
