    I should be studying, but I feel like I should know at least <i>some</i> complex analysis, so here's some very bad preliminary notes, just so I can get a "feel" of it. 
    <br><br>

    So like complex numbers are like \(z = x + iy\) where \(x,y \in \mathbb{R}\) and \(i^2 = -1\). So we have a couple of functions defined for complex numbers:

    $$e^z  = e^x (\text{cos}(y) + i \text{sin} y)$$
    $$\text{cos} (z) = \frac{e^{iz} + e^{-iz}}{2}$$
    $$\text{sin} (z) = \frac{e^{iz} - e^{-iz}}{2i}$$
    $$\text{log} (z)  = \text{ln} |z| + i \text{arg}(z)$$

    Where \(\text{arg}\) gives the angle of the complex vector (sort of). Of course, there could be heaps of angles for a single complex number, so there's a 'principle branch of log', which uses \(\text{Arg}(z)\), defined in the range \([-\pi,\pi]\). 
    <br><br>

    Derivatives and Integration is defined as normally, and all the normal rules apply. There is one caveat. Suppose we have the complex function: 

    $$f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$$

    for \(f\) to be differentiable at \(z_0\), we need to have the following equations hold (Cauchy-Riemann Equations)

    $$\frac{\delta u}{\delta x} (x_0, y_0) = \frac{\delta v}{\delta y} (x_0, y_0)$$
    $$\frac{\delta u}{\delta y} (x_0, y_0) = - \frac{\delta v}{\delta x} (x_0, y_0)$$

    This comes from taking the partial of \(f\) in the \(x\) direction and the \(y\) direction. 
    <br><br>
    Anyway, skipping forward to some cool stuff. Suppose that \(f\) is analytic in a region containing a closed curve \(C\) with positive orientation, and suppose that \(z_0\) is inside \(C\). Then it turns out that 

    $$f(z_0) = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_C \frac{f(z)}{z-z_0} dz$$

    In fact we have that if \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) are 'homotopic' closed curves (loosely meaning that they can be continuously deformed into one another), then we have that 

    $$\int_{C_1} f(z) dz = \int_{C_2} f(z) dz$$

    and if \(f\) has no holes inside \(C\), 

    $$\int_{C} f(z) dz = 0$$

    Anyway, back to studying.
