    <!--it's not really random i swear-->
    <p>Random number: 08</p>
    <p>4th December 2016</p>

    On Saturday the 3rd of December, I got my mind and body whipped so hard that everything inverted and was replaced in a flash of light in the event known as the Putnam. It's been a day however, so let's look back at the exam in an act of retrospection.

    <br><b>A1.</b> Find the smallest positive integer \(j\) such that for every polynomial \(p(x)\) with integer coefficients and for every integer \(k\), the integer
    $$p^{(j)}(k) = \frac{d^j}{dx^j}p(x)\Big|_{x=k}$$
    (the \(j\)-th derivative of \(p(x)\) at \(k\)) is divisible by 2016.
    </div>
    </div>


    <br>
    <i>My Cool Solution:</i>
    <br><br>
    I claim that \(j = 8\). Take an arbitrary polynomial \(p(x) = a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_1x+a_0\). Then we have that:

    $$\frac{d^8}{dx^8}p(x) = \sum_{m} a_m(m)(m-1)(m-2)...(m-6)(m-7)x^{m-8}$$

    When evaluated at an integer \(k\), it's clear that all of the terms in the sum above are integers, and that they divide eight consecutive integers. Out of these eight, at least 3 must be divisible by 2, and one of those by 4, meaning that each term is divisible by \(2^5\). Also, at least two of the eight integers are divisible by 3, and one divisible by 7, which means that each term is divisible by 9 and 7. This means that each term in the sum is divisible by \(2^5*9*7 = 2016\), hence the eighth derivative of any polynomial is divisble by 2016.

    <br><br>
    To prove that \(j = 8\) is minimal, the polynomial \(q(x) = x^7\) is a counterexample for \(j = 1, 2, 3,...7\), as 
    $$q^{(j)}(1) \text{ mod } 2016 \neq 0$$

    And that concludes my beautiful proof.

    <br><b>A2.</b> Given a positive integer \(n\), let \(M(n)\) be the largest integer \(m\) such that 
    $${{m}\choose{n-1}} > {{m-1}\choose{n}}$$
    Evaluate
    $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{M(n)}{n}$$
    </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <i>My Cool Solution:</i>
    <br><br>
    $${{m}\choose{n-1}} > {{m-1}\choose{n}}$$
    $$\frac{m!}{(n-1)!}{(m-n+1)!} > \frac{(m-1)!}{n!(m-n-1)!}$$
    $$m^2 + (1-3n)m + (n^2 - n) < 0$$
    For a given \(n\), we can use the quadratic formula:
    <br><br>
    $$\frac{(3n-1) - \sqrt{5n^2-2n+1}}{2} < m < \frac{(3n-1) + \sqrt{5n^2-2n+1}}{2}$$
    $$\frac{(3n-1) + \sqrt{5n^2-2n+1}}{2}-1 < M(n) < \frac{(3n-1) + \sqrt{5n^2-2n+1}}{2}$$
    $$\frac{(3-\frac{1}{n}) + \sqrt{5-\frac{2}{n}+\frac{1}{n^2}}}{2}-\frac{1}{n} < \frac{M(n)}{n} < \frac{(3-\frac{1}{n}) + \sqrt{5-\frac{2}{n}+\frac{1}{n^2}}}{2}$$
    Now we can apply the squeeze theorem, as the lower bound and upper bound both limit to the same number as \(n \rightarrow \infty\). We find then that
    $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} M(n) = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$$
    And that concludes my beautiful proof.

    <br><b>A3.</b> Suppose that \(f\) is a function from \(\mathbb{R}\) to \(\mathbb{R}\) such that 
    $$f(x) + f(1-\frac{1}{x}) = \text{arctan}(x)$$
    for all real \(x \neq 0\). (As usual, \(y = \text{arctan}(x)\) means \(-\pi /2 < y < \pi /2\) and \(\text{tan}(y) = x\).) Find

    $$\int_0^1 f(x) dx$$
    </div>
    </div>

    I'll write up the proof for this tomorrow.
