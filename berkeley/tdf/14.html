    So I think this is a solution for the first B problem:

    <br><br>

    <div class = 'pb'>
    <div class = 'pt'>
    <b>B1</b>. Let \(x_0,x_1,x_2,...\) be the sequence such that \(x_0 = 1\) and for \(n \geq 0\),
    $$x_{n+1} = \text{ln} (e^{x_n} - x_n)$$
    (as usual, the function ln is the natural logarithm). Show that the infinite series
    $$x_0 + x_1 + x_2 + ...$$
    converges and find its sum.
    </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    So here's my spiffy solution. I don't want to go full hardcore on all the little real-analysis-ey details, but it should stand up to the test.
    <br><br>
    It is easy to show that \(x_n\) is a decreasing sequence (by the monotonic increasing of the log function) and that it is bounded below by zero. Hence, there exists some \(\delta \geq 0\) such that \(\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = \delta\). Suppose that this limit is greater than 0. Then:
    $$\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists N \in \mathbb{N}, \forall n > N : \delta \leq x_n \leq \delta + \epsilon$$
    We know that \(x_n \leq 1\), so we have for large enough \(n\):
    $$\text{ln}(e^{\delta}-x_n) \leq \text{ln}(e^{x_n} - x_n) \leq \text{ln}(e^{\delta + \epsilon} - x_n)$$
    But the middle part is equal to \(x_{n+1}\), and the \(x_n\) can be simplified with our first limit inequality, resulting in:
    $$x_{n+1} \leq \text{ln}(e^{\delta + \epsilon} - \delta)$$
    But \(\text{ln}(e^{\delta + \epsilon} - \delta)\) is a function in \(\epsilon\) that is continuous at \(\epsilon = 0\), hence we can find a small enough \(\epsilon\) such that we have
    $$x_{n+1} \leq \text{ln}(e^{\delta} - \delta) < \delta$$
    which proves that \(\delta\) is not the limit of the strictly decreasing sequence \(x_n\) if it is greater than 0, hence \(\lim_{x \to \infty} x_n = 0\)
    <br><br>
    We can then notice that, if we define \(S_n\) as the partial sum from \(x_0\) to \(x_n\), that the relationship
    $$x_{n+1} = \text{ln}(e - S_n)$$
    holds (proving it by easy induction). We then have the relationship that
    $$\lim_{n \to \infty} x_{n+1} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \text{ln} (e - S_n) = 0$$
    Now due to the fact that ln is a strictly increasing function, and that \(S_n\) is also strictly increasing, it is clear that \(S_n\) must converge to \((e - 1)\). 

    <br><br>
    I'm still not done with part A though; like I'm really sucking with the Group Theory question; it just feels like something I'll facepalm over if I see the answer.
