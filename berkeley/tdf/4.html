    <p style="font-size: 30px">First Loses NoCycle for Small \(n\)</p>
    <!--it's not really random i swear-->
    <p>Random number: 29</p>
    <p>2nd December 2016</p>

    So I made a minimax algorithm to check who wins the <a href = "3.html">NoCycle</a> game for small values of \(n\). It was a very tiring experience, but turns out for \(n\) up to \(7\) first player always loses. I feel like that's enough empirical evidence to prove that for all \(n\), first player loses. Just gut feeling. 

    There were some parts to it though, alpha-beta pruning... Too Tired.
