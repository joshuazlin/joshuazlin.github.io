    <!--it's not really random i swear-->
    <p>Random number: 72</p>
    <p>So the idea is that every day I'll try to find something 'interesting' to post here. Of course, it's impossible to find interesting things on a day-to-day basis, but I'll try anyway, in the hopes that over time I come across more interesting things than usual, and that I'll get better at figuring out what things look interesting at first glance.</p>
    <br> <p>Note that this was written throughout my freshman year, and I have since changed (for better or worse, I am not yet sure).
