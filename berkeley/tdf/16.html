    <b>A5.</b> Suppose that \(G\) is a finite group generated by the two elements \(g\) and \(h\), where the order of \(g\) is odd. Show that every element of \(G\) can be written in the form 
    $$g^{m_1}h^{n_1}g^{m_2}h^{n_2}...g^{m_r}h^{n_r}$$
    with \(1 \leq r \leq |G|\) and \(m_1,n_1,m_2,n_2,...,m_r,n_r \in \{-1,1\}\). (Here \(|G|\) is the number of elements of \(G\).)

    The legend came by and blessed with his beneficience the solution became apparent. Since \(|G|\) is finite, we have that \(|gh|\) is finite. Call an element \(gh\)-colourable if it can be expressed in the form shown in the question, but not worrying about the \(r \leq |G|\) restriction (but keeping the \(1 \leq r\) restriction) 
    $$ghgh...gh = e$$
    $$hghgh...gh = g^{-1}$$
    $$h^{-1}g^{-1}h^{-1}g^{-1}h^{-1}...g^{-1}h^{-1} = g$$
    $$gh^{-1}g^{-1}h^{-1}g^{-1}h^{-1}...g^{-1}h^{-1} = g^2$$
    Now because \(|g|\) is odd, then for any \(k\) there exists an \(m\) such that \(g^k = mg^2\), therefore all powers of \(g\) are \(gh\)-colourable. Therefore we know that \(g^{-1}\) is \(gh\)-colourable. Therefore we know that \(g^{-1}gh = h\) is \(gh\)-colourable. We also know that since \(|h|\) is finite, we have that \(h^k = h^{-1}\) for some integer \(k\), which implies that \(h^{-1}\) is \(gh\)-colourable. Now we have that \(g,h,g^{-1},h^{-1}\) are all \(gh\)-colourable. But we also know the group \(G\) is generated by \(g\) and \(h\), therefore every element can be written as products of \(g,h,g^{-1},h^{-1}\), which means that every element is \(gh\)-colourable. 
    <br><br>
    Now to ensure that every number is colourable with \(r \leq |G|\). Now denote by \(A_k\) the set of all elements expressible as \(g^{m_1}h^{n_1}g^{m_2}h^{n_2}...g^{m_k}h^{n_k}\), with \(m_i,n_i \in \{-1,1\}\) for all \(i\). Since we know that all elements are \(gh\)-colourable, then there must be a smallest integer \(p\) such that \(\cup_{q = 1}^p A_q\) contains all the elements of \(G\), so we want to show that \(p \leq |G|\). For some \(a,b : a < b \leq p\), suppose that \(A_a = A_b\). But we also know that \(A_a = A_b\) implies \(A_{a+1} = A_{b+1}\), and \(A_{a+2} = A_{b+2}\), so that \(A_{p} = A_{(p - b + a)}\). But this would imply that \(\cup_{q = 1}^p A_p = \cup_{q = 1}^{p - b + a} A_q\), which suggests that there is a number \((p-b+a)\) less than \(p\) that generates all the elements of the group \(G\), contradicting the definition of \(p\). Hence, we must have that \(A_a \neq A_b\) for all satisfactory \(a,b\). This implies that we can construct a sequence \(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,...\alpha_p\) such that \(\alpha_i \in A_i\) and all the \(\alpha\) are unique. This is impossible if \(p > |G|\). Hence \(p \leq |G|\).
