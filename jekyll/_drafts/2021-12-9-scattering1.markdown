## 1+1d Quantum Mechanics

In one-dimensional quantum mechanics, the hilbert space is given by square integrable functions $$\mathcal{L}^2(\mathbb{R})$$ over the real line, and the hamiltonian is some real-valued operator taking the form $$H = \frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x) = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V(x)$$ using the canonical $$[x,p] = i \hbar, p = i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x}$$. Evolution is given by the operator $$e^{-itH}$$. To describe scattering in the most conservative setting, we need $$V(x) \to 0$$ as $$x \to \infty$$, in which case we can define:
